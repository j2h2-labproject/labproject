# LabProject

LabProject is a web-based virtual lab environment, giving users the ability to create and manage labs consisting of virtual machines and switches. The goal is to give professionals, students, instructors, and everybody else a way to easily create and interact with virtual networks alongside other users. Essentially, this would be a cloud for education, research, and experimentation.

NOTE: This project is very much a work in progress. A lot of stuff is not implemented.

## Why LabProject?

There are many different applications for providing cloud services, but almost all of them are oriented towards commercial and business applications. There are very few that focus on education and experimentation, and LabProject seeks to fill this gap. This project will allow users to easily create and interact with networks that can be used by teams of people simultaneously.

Possible use cases could be:
* College courses
* Competitions
* Personal experiments

## Planned Features
* A web interface for interacting with labs, virtual machines and virtual switches
* Virtualization of PCs, servers and entire networks using popular, modern virtualization technologies
* Support for multiple users interacting with the same lab
* Support for mutiple hypervisors
* Support for muliple VM-hosting servers
* (?) Tools for distribution of labs
* (?) Tools for automated and scripted lab creation
