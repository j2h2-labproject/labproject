# LabProject

LabProject is a web-based virtual lab environment, giving users the ability to create labs consisting of virtual machines and switches. The goal is to give professionals, students, instructors and everybody else a way to easily create and interact with virtual networks alongside other users.

NOTE: This project is very much a work in progress. A lot of stuff is not implemented.

### Planned Features:
* A web interface for interacting with labs, virtual machines and virtual switches
* Virtualization of PCs, servers and entire networks using popular, modern virtualization technologies
* Support for multiple users interacting with the same lab
* Support for mutiple hypervisors
* Support for muliple VM-hosting servers
* (?) Tools for distribution of labs
* (?) Tools for automated and scripted lab creation
